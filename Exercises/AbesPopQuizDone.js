//1.)There are 3 javascript keywords to initialize a variable. create A new variable below called value and set it to an empty string

let value = ""
const value = ""
const value = ""


//2.)JavaScript has many data types. String is an example of one. Name 2 more

Number
Boolean
Truthy
Falsey
Array
Object

//3.)Evaluate the following statements: [What would this line of code return in my console]
//Don't run these exact line of code! [anything close is allowed]
    //4A.) console.log("4" + 4)
    //4B.) console.log("4" * 4)
    //4C.) console.log("4" == 4)
    //4D.) console.log("Tefe".indexOf("E"))
    // 4E.) console.log("Javascript Is Fun".split(" "))

    44
    44
    false
    -1
    ["Javascript", "Is", "Fun"]

//4.)Write a function that takes an array as input and console logs each element in the array

function printArray(arr){
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        console.log(arr[i])
    }
} 
//5.) Which of the following statements is not true about for loop statement:

    //A.) You can declare a variable in a for loop 
    //B.) You can't make an infinite loop in a for loop
    //C.) You can exit out of a for loop with the break keyword
    //D.) For loops can increment upwards dowards or even not at all  //ask for clarifcation if this is confusing you

// A. ? you can declare a variable to iterate like i so I would say a is true ?
// B. false

//6.) Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the average of all the numbers

function average(arr){
    let sum = 0
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        sum = arr[i] + sum;
    } return sum/arr.length
}

//7.) You are given a dataset where you have nested arrays of information and you need to sort through all that information to sum up all the numbers.
/*
ie.

const matrix = [[1,2,[4,55],[41,455],[525,525,[13,567,96,33]],[45,4145,682]]]
*/
    //7A.) There are two potential 1 word answers for the name the approach you need to take to solve this problem. Name either one [ First one starts with I, Second one starsts with R ]
    //7B.) In 1-2 sentances explain high level [like if you were explaining to a 5 year old] what your approach to solving this would be.

    // Itteration and Recursion

    //I am going to write some instructions that will tell the computer to look at the list of numbers (that can also have another list of numbers in the list!) so that it will loop over 
    //all the numbers in the list and add them all up. Isn't that awesome?!
